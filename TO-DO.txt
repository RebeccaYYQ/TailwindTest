For index 1
Card 1
    Has shadowing

Card 3 
    top border has slants on edges
    top border may be wrong color

Card 5
    the grey border is around header

------------------------------------------------
For index 2
Check I didn't mess up margin and padding again

Card structure - header and content divs, make that consistent
    where should padding sit? 

Instead of margins, maybe use space between 
Text has padding on top and bottom

Shadow for card 1 and 5 might be off

Card 1
    Missing shadowing
    Icon size
    Line height is diff. but its minor.

Card 2
    Sizing but hard to tell with card 1 as diff size.

Card 3
    Same issue as index 1

Card 5
    the grey border is around header
    checked appearance
    I changed the padding pretty noticably

GA Lifetime table

-----------------

    card 4 the -> icon doesn't change color

Click states

Dummy links

-----------------------
Responsiveness to fix
Card 1
    I used a grid method but it feels like the long way to go about it 
    asdljf its not working, maybe having the text warp around the image in the mobile verison and grouping the header and the text would be a solution
    or negative margins on the top to bring it up
    margins on things (icon, body text)

Card 2
    The dates also change (from xx/xx/xx to day month)
